3,"Infection Control Android","This app started in Android before moving more recently into iOS. Originally an idea of my father's, I began this app to help solve an issue of data collection and data visualization for his department, Infection Control, at work. However, as I worked out the details with him, it became more apparent how helpful this app could be for not only his own hospital but for hospitals in general. In his experience, hospitals often lag behind in terms of technology, despite being able to benefit immensely from the revolution data collection and computeres can bring.  Ideally as I further pursue this project to its limits, I can generalize and help a number of different hospitals, beginning with local clinics, offering a cheap and user friendly experience to help those in need. Beginning with the Android app, I wanted a simple user interface that would quickly and immediately enable users to create reports when needed. In addition, I wanted to ensure that administrative users had the tools to cater to their clinics needs, adapting the base app as necessary. While the settings portion of the app is still a work in progress, the biggest challenges came from filtering reports and implementing nested Recycler Views. Both will be improved upon to some degree, but getting them done as neatly as possible was a huge point of pride and an important set of lessons in routine Android app development. In the future, I'll add graphs and improved filtering as with the Android app. In addition to this, I expect to improve the settings to allow administrative staff control, look, feel and data collectable.","https://github.com/NLCaceres/Android-Records",,0,0,7,"2022-12-12 05:26:21.967769","2022-12-12 05:26:21.967769"
8,"A Few of My Favorite Foods from Around the World","I found that as I developed these Android apps, the entire operating system felt very intuitive and just as customizable as a developer as it is for a user. Naturally it was important for our teacher to remind us that it's not always necessary to re-invent the wheel, so we took a look at a very commonly used 3rd party dependency, Glide. Using Glide we could load in images to the image view based on URL, and create that much more intuitive and creative apps. With this simple example, every flag was clickable, and when clicked, the URL would change, revealing a different food item that the student enjoyed .","https://github.com/NLCaceres/Foods-Around-the-World",,0,1,2,"2022-12-12 05:26:22.785262","2022-12-12 05:26:22.785262"
7,"How Do You Take Your Morning Coffee?","After learning the basics of Android development, the goal here was to take a look at the various UI options in the Android toolkit and use them in conjunction with basic object oriented programming.

Adding in the feature to calculate currency conversions and unit conversions helped to establish that programming done right can be as simple as dropping in features to speed up development and create enormous and well-built projects.","https://github.com/NLCaceres/Multi-Func-Calculator-Android",,0,1,11,"2022-12-12 05:26:23.294141","2022-12-12 05:26:23.294141"
9,"Try and Escape!","After several basic attempts, it was finally time to learn something a bit more complicated and specific to how the Android OS works, fragments. Using fragments, the goal was to use a single activity to contain all the screens of the App, being sure they all interacted with each other as necessary. In the end, I created an escape room type game with several 'rooms', each with a different puzzle to solve, that the user needs to complete to beat the entire game.","https://github.com/NLCaceres/Escape-Room-Puzzle-Game",,0,1,12,"2022-12-12 05:26:22.95723","2022-12-12 05:26:22.95723"
1,"Aspiring Jack of All Trades","	 Hi there! My name is Nicholas Caceres, and thanks for coming to my portfolio site! Here you'll find my small endeavors into the Software Development world ranging from front-end to mobile and even lower-level GUI programming.  As a graduate of the University of Southern California, I started and finished as a Biology major, but, along the way, I managed to pick up two minors, one in East Asian Languages and Cultures, and the other in Mobile App Development. After rooming with three friends my sophomore year, one friend, majoring in International Relations, encouraged me to indulge in my love of language-learning. I took up Chinese Mandarin, and, after four years, I learned so much about the amazing, long-lived and beautiful culture. Meanwhile, my other two roommates encouraged me to go in a completely different direction, and said I should take a Computer Science class. As I did, I loved it and thought I'd make a new hobby of programming by taking on a Mobile App Development minor. However, as I took more and more courses in the curriculum, I realized that software engineering should definitely play a bigger part in my life than just as a fun hobby and life skill. On one hand I still loved Biology, in particular Neuroscience and Genetics, but on the other, I came to the conclusion that the future of Biology lies in the incredible new technology being developed to gain a deeper understanding of it. If I wanted to help advance not only academia but most importantly, human health, then Software Development would be just as big of a part of my education and work life. After graduating from USC, I committed myself to expanding my skill set in modern Software Development while working full-time and helping my family. If I thought balancing my education, work and family was difficult in college, I found it was even tougher after finishing, when life can throw you curveballs even quicker. Despite any shortcomings and a lengthier timeline than expected, I feel proud looking back at the amount of work I've done, the improvements I've made, and the number of topics I've covered in both the Software development world and the worlds I've weaved into my projects, including Healthcare, Auto Sales, and even Marvel Comics. No matter what field I work in, bringing a satisfying experience to any person who comes into contact with my work is my ultimate end goal.   Aside from software development, I've been a waiter, pizza and package delivery guy, and even a property manager. Having worked in these other fields has shaped my mentality immensely, certainly contributing to my desire to always ensure clients, family or friends are content. In addition to refining my customer service skills and the eye for user experience that USC gave me, I feel working in different lines of work has also helped my confidence, proving to myself I'm capable of adapting and producing excellent results in each. Moreover, it's given me a deeper insight into the process and needs of different companies, imparting the importance of taking the time to truly understand one's work environment, client needs, and coworker synergy.  While it seems there's always time for work, after it all, it doesn't get much better than grabbing a good meal and seeing a movie with my friends. It's a pastime I've kept since high school with friends I've kept since elementary school, and I hope to continue it for the rest of my life. Once I'm home, having played guitar for over half my life now, my guitar is second only to my little puppy, Isabella, and my longtime girlfriend, Kat; the three couldn't make me happier. With such good friends and such good family always supporting me, I'm fortunate enough to have had the opportunity to learn at USC and had the ability to accomplish any goals I've set in my mind. As a young software developer, having worked tirelessly to prepare myself, I'm ready and eager for wherever life takes me next, carrying the torch and taking it as far as I can go. Fight On!","https://github.com/NLCaceres","",,,4,"2022-12-12 05:26:21.65167","2023-01-16 01:59:09.392794"
10,"A Simple Tip Calculator","Using listeners with Android's typical UI, it was super simple and quick to make this nifty little tip calculator.

4,"Work-it Android","Ever since I started learning iOS, I hoped to be able to duplicate my projects in Android. Eventually, I would be able to take a class focused on Android and use the knowledge that came from learning iOS to move more smoothly into Android. As stated in my iOS section, the idea for this app came from conversations with my best friend about an all encompassing fitness and health app. There are plenty of apps that cover nutrition, and plenty that cover exercise, but we wanted an app that would fit it all in one clean space.","https://github.com/NLCaceres/WorkIt-Android",,0,0,0,"2022-12-12 05:26:22.162423","2022-12-12 05:26:22.162423"
13,"Enter the Hazard Room","As I worked on my final project, Positive Note, my class continued to improve upon basic skills, teaching me a new skill that I hadn't learned much from my iOS development, database interactions. It's this app experience that encouraged me to use Firebase for maintaining messaging and user data. Overall as frustrating as finishing a text based game in Android was, it was an extremely worthwhile experience and one that I still reference for a deeper and more base level understanding of Android's cursor handling of databases. This knowledge certainly serves one well for implementing CLEAN architecture and Android's Room Persistance library.","https://github.com/NLCaceres/Hazard-Room-Game",,0,1,3,"2022-12-12 05:26:23.640866","2022-12-12 05:26:23.640866"
17,"Infection Control Angular Front-end","Originally an idea of my father's, I began this app on iOS and Android, and quickly began to build out the back-end to collect the data pertinent to an Infection Control Department. As I did, I increasingly wanted to work with Angular 2+, not only for a better understanding of the difference between React and Angular front-ends but also to provide a central hub for hospital administrators to control data flow, visualization and preferences. While the average healthcare worker in Infection Control would likely use the phone apps constantly on the go, a centralized hub could yield even grander results by keeping hospital management in the loop, letting them track reports or control settings for staff, providing an extremely useful feature that would be indispensable once fully fledged. With Heroku moving away from its free tier, I plan to look for a cost-effective hosting solution that will be secure, fast, and always reliable. Given my struggles working with Angular and my success working with Vue, in the future, I also plan on reevaluating whether Angular is the right choice for developing a central online hub for healthcare workers to quickly access and administrate hospital-wide Infection Prevention data.","https://github.com/NLCaceres/ng-records","",2,0,2,"2022-12-12 05:26:24.358586","2023-02-11 05:56:54.851461"
18,"This Portfolio Site!","Having not worked with React ever before (or any front-end framework for that matter), I wanted to take my time, learn every detail of the framework I chose, and also make a project that truly meant something to me. It was immediately clear to me upon further thought that I would start with my Portfolio website. Since first starting this site, I feel I've come a long way in my software development skills not only in Front-End web development but entirely as a software engineer. Every year, I've learned something new from my Android, iOS, back-end, and front-end development, and each time I do, I find how I can tie in my new learnings into those other fields of development, constantly leveling up my projects and constantly becoming more proud of how far I've come as a developer.

19,"Car Lords - The New Car Site to Compete and Beat the Rest","For my last assignment of my ITP 301 class for Web Dev, I wanted to create something that I would find useful in my own life. Though it was incredibly difficult to find data relating to cars (even basic info like car models and makes), over time I was able to accomplish a great deal with limited time and resources. Using the Edmunds API (ten requests a day at the time), I was able to carefully test my Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation skills and the page itself. Without a front-end framework, I managed to create three 'pages' that dealt with the initial search for a car of a certain model, make and year, displayed a list of articles related to a search keyword, and displayed a list of nearby new and used cars available to buy. If I could amass a free use collection of car data, I'd love to get this project going again, but unfortunately Edmunds made the data entirely private.","https://github.com/NLCaceres/carSearch-Site","https://nlcaceres.github.io/carSearch-Site/",2,0,2,"2022-12-12 05:26:24.748272","2022-12-12 05:26:24.748272"
15,"Starting Small with Django","When I first started learning about the back-end, I knew it simply as a REST API that I could access through given urls, but had no clue about the endless world of frameworks that existed. One of the first ones I learned about was Django. Having never taken a class on the back-end, I used my basic web development experience and Mozilla guides to create a simple library web app. While I didn't fully understand it when creating it, the simplicity of working Django made the learning fun and a great starting point. Between templating for HTML, highlighting the importance of DRY coding, using Heroku and much more, Django as a framework and Mozilla's guide to it are excellent options for an aspiring full-stack developer.","github-url",,1,1,0,"2022-12-12 05:26:24.000895","2022-12-12 05:26:24.000895"
20,"The Walking Dead Fansite","My first official attempt at anything related to Web Development and the Front-End. In my USC class ITP 301, we were instructed to create a fansite for one of our favorite TV shows. At the time, the Walking Dead was probably at its highest viewership with the shock of the season 7 opening and 6 excellent seasons prior. In my little project, I'd create a simple html file with simple css talking about the main characters and the first 5 seasons.","https://github.com/NLCaceres/WD-show-fanpage","https://nlcaceres.github.io/WD-show-fanpage/",2,1,1,"2022-12-12 05:26:24.946375","2022-12-12 05:26:24.946375"
21,"My Girlfriend and I's Photo Gallery","As a part of the second assignment for my ITP 301 class, we made a point of overviewing jQuery for a couple weeks which culminated in this project, a simple gallery using jQuery to highlight images and when clicked, the image would be swapped into the main frame.","https://github.com/NLCaceres/jQuery-gallery","https://nlcaceres.github.io/jQuery-gallery/",2,1,1,"2022-12-12 05:26:25.082738","2022-12-12 05:26:25.082738"
22,"Color my Life","In the third assignment for ITP 301, the task was even more simple than the previous one, namely create a page that describes your life in a nutshell AND use javascript to modify the CSS of various parts of the page. Using radio buttons and a pair of JS functions, a user can easily swap out the background to whatever basic colors they want and to a font color they'd prefer.","https://github.com/NLCaceres/js-color-control","https://nlcaceres.github.io/js-color-control/",2,1,1,"2022-12-12 05:26:25.271535","2022-12-12 05:26:25.271535"
24,"The New and Improved Photo Gallery","Improving upon the previous jQuery gallery my ITP 301 class had made, I'd change the layout adding more images, focus it around my girlfriend and I's Walt Disney World trip, using vanilla Javascript alone. The main image frame and row images would function similarly, highlighting when the mouse hovers over and swapping on click, but I'd include a row of random images underneath the main frame and above the larger full gallery of images. With the row of random images, I included a random button that would choose a set of three images to display (though it could choose two of the same). Not perfect, but a good step towards a fully fledged project and one heck of a road trip!","https://github.com/NLCaceres/js-gallery","https://nlcaceres.github.io/js-gallery/",2,1,1,"2022-12-12 05:26:25.590172","2022-12-12 05:26:25.590172"
25,"These are a Few of My Favorite Sites","In order to practice HTML manipulation and get a feel for the power Javascript had over the Document Object Model, my class would make one of its last projects, a search bar scanning through a few arrays with website names and keywords related to those websites. Pressing enter with an empty search bar will give you a full list of around 20 websites that I use whether for news, for entertainment or for shopping, but otherwise the search bar will act as one might expect and return any websites that relate to the keyword a user types in.","https://github.com/NLCaceres/bookmark-search","https://nlcaceres.github.io/bookmark-search/",2,1,1,"2022-12-12 05:26:25.734191","2022-12-12 05:26:25.734191"
26,"The Group Project - Flip through a Fun Van Gogh Flipbook","As my semester came to a close in ITP 301 Intro to Web Dev, my professor was sure to incorporate a group project into the class, pairing Computer Science Majors with Computer Science Minors. Having the minor under my belt, I paired with a classmate, Duncan, a CS Major. Though our schedules didn't ever seem to fit, this was the perfect opportunity to make use of Github. With Github on our side, we were able to divide and conquer fairly quickly. Unfortunately our merge conflicts made things difficult as our presentations finally arrived, but we fixed them in record time and had a presentable flipbook for all to enjoy.","https://github.com/NLCaceres/itp301-group-project","https://nlcaceres.github.io/itp301-group-project/",2,1,3,"2022-12-12 05:26:25.88967","2022-12-12 05:26:25.88967"
28,"Work-it iOS","One of my first major iOS projects. The idea came from conversations with my best friend about an all encompassing fitness and health app. There are plenty of apps that cover nutrition, and plenty that cover exercise, but we wanted an app that would fit it all in one clean space. Using this project for my second iOS class, the undertaking was far too much to manage in a month, but I found this realization helped me for future projects by teaching me better project management and setting realistic goals. Between the number of screens, the number of 3rd party APIs, and novel features that I had hoped to implement, it was a major challenge, even now, that remains unfinished. One day I hope to be able to overcome those technical issues and see this app fully fledged and combined with my first app, Recipes Galore.","https://github.com/NLCaceres/WorkIt-iOS",,4,0,9,"2022-12-12 05:26:26.267987","2022-12-12 05:26:26.267987"
29,"Recipes Galore iOS","This was my very first major project in a class. Though I had taken two classes in C++ up to this point, by comparison, this project felt incredibly fleshed out. A simple app with huge endeavours, I had hoped to create an app that would deliver solid recipe recommendations for every ingredient you may have had in your fridge. Though I could never figure out barcode scanning (as an easier way to insert ingredients in your virtual fridge), I'm glad I managed to implement a majority of the app despite rookie mistakes such as multiple segues to the same view controller. This project would continue to influence me in the direction I wanted to take my apps, hoping to improve the lives of the users and their health (like Work it and currently Infection Control). Though, in retrospect, I had made quite a few mistakes in my early Software Development career, I feel I've come a very long way since then. Having recently cleaned up my code and updated some UI for better user experience, I look fondly at my beginnings and excitedly for my future.","https://github.com/NLCaceres/recipes-galore",,4,0,11,"2022-12-12 05:26:26.430037","2022-12-12 05:26:26.430037"
30,"Keeping Data Secured ...as Long as the Bugs Don't Leak Them. iOS","This was one of my last projects that used Objective-C, and would have been a fun example of keychain, using internal passwords or fingerprints securely. Unfortunately, keychain was horribly bugged at the time and required at least a few workarounds to get it to properly work. After searching tirelessly to find some way to make keychain work as intended and expected based on Apple's documentation, I found several suggestions on StackOverflow and various sites online on what to change to enable keychain. Thankfully the workaround I found temporarily fixed keychain for me and finally a user could write notes that were secure from any prying eyes.","https://github.com/NLCaceres/secured-keychain-example",,4,1,5,"2022-12-12 05:26:26.59792","2022-12-12 05:26:26.59792"
31,"Keeping Things Flowing with Background Downloading iOS","This project was built to not only practice working with REST, grabbing images online from various URLs, but also to see how Table Views could be further customized as objects loaded in series. Using Grand Central Dispatch to create queues and handle threads, the project would make GET requests, parse the response, and slide each object as a cell into the table when ready. In addition to sliding in the images, depending on the content of the picture (if Apple's Face recognition API detects faces or not), the app will make adjustments. For those pictures that it detects faces, it'll count them and apply a blur. For those that do not have faces, it'll add hue and exposure, discoloring the image.","https://github.com/NLCaceres/BGDownloaderExample",,4,1,3,"2022-12-12 05:26:26.764185","2022-12-12 05:26:26.764185"
34,"Quotes to Remember Project","This project encompassed the enirety of a semester when I first learned how to create iOS apps. On and off, the class was instructed to further add features to this app given the new information we had just learned. Beginning with a shared model (singleton pattern) and plists, we created the initial screen displaying quotes in the cloud on tap. Eventually, we added more gesture recognizers to handle swipes and create favorites. Soon the favorites list was added with the help of delegates and data sources to populate and control the table view, and finally, the add quotes screen was implemented. It didn't seem like much at first, but by the end of the class, it felt like well-thought out app and a fun one to boot!","https://github.com/NLCaceres/Full-Quote-Project",,4,1,7,"2022-12-12 05:26:27.327081","2022-12-12 05:26:27.327081"

36,"Create Your Own Story!","Since iOS is more than just the iPhone after all, my professor ensured that we took the time to play with the iPad Simulator in XCode as well. At the time, constraints were confusing enough for me, so considering the UI as well as making sense of objective C felt tough. Making a fun app in the style of MadLibs, on the other hand, definitely helped to define a concrete goal to work to.","https://github.com/NLCaceres/make-your-own-story",,4,1,5,"2022-12-12 05:26:27.681954","2022-12-12 05:26:27.681954"
33,"Playing with UI-Kit iOS","The remaining apps showcase my simple attempts in several iOS focused classes to incorporate various libraries from Apple and Facebook.

37,"Batman vs Superman iOS","This was the very first iOS project that I ever created. Looking back on at it, it seemed incredibly difficult to make between the constraints, a new language, and actual GUI to interact with. Since then though, I'm proud to see what I learned from this project and what I can do now. This project simply has the background image, a text field for your name, a simple label to dynamically fill, and two buttons for the user to play with. It would take your choice and if you filled in your name, it would insert it into the label with your choice of superhero.","https://github.com/NLCaceres/BvS-iOS",,4,1,2,"2022-12-12 05:26:27.847095","2022-12-12 05:26:27.847095"
2,"Positive Note Android","This was the first major app I wrote in Android. In the class that first taught me Android development, we were asked to create an app that would help those in their day-to-day lives whether that was an acessibility issue, a handicap, or simply a health-related concern. Being a Biology major focused in Neuroscience, I immediately thought about the issue of mental illness. I hoped to create an app that would help users to be able to voice their concerns about their mental well-being if they felt they could not do so easily. Ideally I could create a chat system, map out local mental health professionals, display helpful articles and create a simple login. The biggest concern, and ultimately the task I could not complete, was the chat system. I had hoped to create a system that would connect users who felt they could help in certain topics whether relationships, depression, or simply daily troubles with users who were having trouble in these topics. Though the system was established programmatically with help from Firebase (just before Google acquired it), it didn't function as intended. Consequently, the remainder was fleshed out as best as possible within the time frame, and the chat system was kept basic. Despite my shortcomings, it taught me a number of important lessons from project management, laying out tasks, and interacting with a number of different technologies.","https://github.com/NLCaceres/Positive-note",,0,0,14,"2022-12-12 05:26:21.816163","2022-12-12 05:26:21.816163"
27,"Infection Control iOS","Originally an idea of my father's, I began this app in Android to help solve an issue of data collection and data visualization for his department, Infection & Control, at work. However, as I worked out the details with him, it became more apparent how helpful this app could be for not only his own hospital but for hospitals and clinics in general. In his experience, hospitals often lag behind in terms of technology, despite the huge benefit data collection often brings.  Ideally as I further pursue this project to its limits, I can generalize and help a number of different hospitals, beginning with local clinics, offering a cheap and user friendly experience to help those in need. Beginning this project Android, I understood that there would have to be a few layout changes in order to provide a more Apple approved look and feel, namely report creation. Luckily, reyclerviews could be easily replicated in iOS which made other screens simple while the report creation took the most thinking and effort. Aside from these mentioned screens, being consistent across the two versions led me to spend a fair deal of time pouring through Apple documentation on coloring and customizing existing UI without breaking it or risking a potentially outdated 3rd party tool if not necessary. In the future, I'll add graphs and improved filtering as with the Android app. In addition to this, I expect to improve the settings to allow administrative staff control, look, feel and data collectable.","https://github.com/NLCaceres/iOS-Records",,4,0,4,"2022-12-12 05:26:26.079541","2022-12-12 05:26:26.079541"
12,"Keep a Notebook","After using understanding spinners, the natural progression in Android was to start using List views for a more complex layout. Implementing adapters to feed the list view data was a bit more of a challenge but understanding it helped immensely when recycler views became more common and important in the Android UI ecosystem. Finally after making iOS apps for some time and learning a number of daily-use aspects of Android, my Android apps were starting to feel fully fledged and I was ready for my big semester project after completing a project that would feature some of the most common features of apps, a simple list, saving data and persisting it.","https://github.com/NLCaceres/Note-Book-Android",,0,1,5,"2022-12-12 05:26:23.464672","2022-12-12 05:26:23.464672"
23,"Need a Calculator?","Getting into the groove of my first Web Development class, we finally got into a project that was a bit more practical and useful, a calculator! Picking out a few images for calculator buttons and laying them out as expected for a calculator, I added onClick attributes to each button which would add numbers to the text field sitting atop. As the user clicks the operators along the side, the number will disappear in the text field and allow the next number to be input until you finally click the equals sign and get your result. Simple and plenty useful!","https://github.com/NLCaceres/calculator-webApp","https://nlcaceres.github.io/calculator-webApp/",2,1,1,"2022-12-12 05:26:25.422865","2022-12-12 05:26:25.422865"
38,"Delighted with Dodger Stadium and its many Promotions! - Flask","In another year with the incredibly successful Dodgers, I have been over the moon to get to see them in person again after the 2020 season was nearly nothing but empty stadiums around North America! Even though the Dodgers weren't 2021 World Series winners, I still got to enjoy all the awesome promotions that I remember from my childhood going to games. From replica jerseys to fun Dia de Los Muertos bobbleheads, keeping up with which ones are worth taking the night off to get can be tough since MLB's Dodger website isn't the best. To my surprise, however, the MLB actually seems to have a perfectly open API for a programmer to use in just about any way they see put (except for maliciously, of course). After taking time to work out how the URL itself was formatted along with its many query options, I found that I could do much more than just get the days the Dodgers played. For the time being, though, the Dodgers home schedule plus the promotions that come with each of those games was my primary focus.  Since I had used Django but never Flask before, I thought this was the perfect opportunity to see the appeal in the Flask framework for myself. While I didn't come out Flask's number one fan, it did do exactly what I needed to help any Dodger fan that runs into the same promo schedule dilemma I did! By comparison to Express with Node, I found Flask fairly easy to customize, getting everything I needed and understanding their usage without too much hassle. From creating CLI commands to throttling various routes, Flask really has it all available to it without much of the research work required of Express users. However, I will say that Flask blueprints definitely have a bit of a learning curve with the current documentation available on Pallet's Flask page. Thanks to the power of Python, like Django, Flask is definitely a fun and helpful way to test and improve your Python skills. As the next season quickly approaches, it's my goal to expand the capabilities of this Flask back-end (in addition to its Svelte front-end) so that a Github user could roll out a promotion schedule website for their own favorite team. Besides generalizing much of the logic, I'd like to improve the scheduler so that it's continually updating the promotion schedule as it changes over the course of the season. As with every project I make, this project has plenty more to come and the more ideas that come to mind, the more fun the future holds!","https://github.com/NLCaceres/mlb-team-schedule","",1,0,7,"2022-12-12 05:26:28.021871","2023-02-11 05:18:41.905992"

For the time being, though, the Dodgers home schedule plus the promotions that come with each of those games was my primary focus. Having used React, Angular, and Vue, I found myself curious how Svelte would compare as a young up-and-coming front-end library. For the most part, I've been pleasantly surprised. Svelte is simple and straightforward, combining the well-organized Single-File Component format of Vue with the SOLID, Reactive, Typescript-first nature of Angular. While some of the reactivity may be able to benefit from increased control options, like limiting calls to the API, I can imagine Svelte growing tremendously as SvelteKit begins to more closely rival Remix and NuxtJS. As the next season quickly approaches, it's my goal to expand the capabilities of this Svelte front-end, in addition to its Flask back-end, so that a Github user could roll out a promotion schedule website for their own favorite team. Besides generalizing much of the logic, I'd like to add live updates that ping the MLB's API on-demand by the user. More specifically, this would include a scoreboard, noting basic stats of each inning. As with every project I make, this project has plenty more to come and the more ideas that come to mind, the more fun the future holds!

14,"Infection Control Back-end","This app started in Android before moving more recently into iOS. Originally an idea of my father's, I began this app to help solve an issue of data collection and data visualization for his department, Infection Control, at work. However, as I worked out the details with him, it became more apparent how helpful this app could be for not only his own hospital but in general. In his experience, hospitals often lag behind in terms of technology, despite being able to benefit immensely from the revolution data collection and computeres can bring. Ideally as I further pursue this project to its limits, I can generalize and help a number of different hospitals, beginning with local clinics, offering a cheap and user friendly experience to help those in need. In this side of the project, I explored the Express framework and the flexibility it provides by being an entirely unopinionated back-end solution. In my experience trying out different frameworks, Express's flexibility can be great, but for a beginner it can come with quite the learning curve causing me to spend a lot longer finding middleware and other solutions to implement expected features like security, authentication and more. While the learning experience is worthwhile, I do expect to change the framework I use in this project.","https://github.com/NLCaceres/express-records","",1,0,0,"2022-12-12 05:26:23.809691","2023-02-11 05:24:36.895873"
16,"Running React with Ruby on Rails","In constant pursuit of a better understanding of the back-end as well as the different sides of modern software development, my latest attempts have included Ruby on Rails and Dot Net. In this particular attempt, I wanted to add Rails to my existing ReactJS Resume Portfolio project site. In my previous Angular 2+ Infection Control project, I separated the front-end from the NodeJS back-end into two Heroku-deployed apps, enabling cross-origin resource sharing. In this case, I wanted to circumvent CORS issues altogether by having a single project that was served by Rails, instead of Express, and rendered dynamically by React. Using Rails as a REST API, I could eliminate the existing JSON files containing data, store the information online via PostgreSQL and explore new options for arranging the page. Since originally starting this Ruby on Rails backend, I've been able to grow tremendously as a developer, learning new techniques to serve my React front-end, manage and curate content, as well as keep it secure on both ends, adding extra insurance via 3rd parties like Cloudflare. As I continue to improve my Portfolio website, I hope to find a cost-effective solution to my Contact Me page emailing, incorporating Github Actions to automatically run tests then deploy to Railway, and further improve the text composition and formatting behind the scenes for my front-end.","https://github.com/NLCaceres/resume-react-rails6","",1,0,0,"2022-12-12 05:26:24.17944","2023-02-11 05:39:46.126921"
